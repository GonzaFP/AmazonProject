# AmazonProject
This is a simple imitation of a modern E-commerce site. A user can browse products according to their categories or search for them, he/she can add/remove cart items and when he/she is ready to buy an item, 
there is a check-out form to fill. This project was built with the aim of practising and honing my skills in the following areas:

* API calls and promises.
* Firebase.
* React hooks such as useContext, useNavigation, useReducer, useParams and useSearchParams.
* Redux and Redux toolkit.
* Working with json-server.

Pull requests are welcome.
